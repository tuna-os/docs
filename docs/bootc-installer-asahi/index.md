The Apple Silicon (Asahi Linux) installer path for TunaOS-family bootc images
— and anyone else's (Dakota, Bluefin, Bazzite): a macOS-driven install flow
for M1/M2 Macs.

**Architecture** (see [docs/DESIGN.md](https://github.com/tuna-os/bootc-installer-asahi/blob/main/docs/DESIGN.md)): instead of one
installer payload per variant×desktop, we ship **one minimal bootstrap
payload** whose first boot runs [fisherman](https://github.com/projectbluefin/fisherman)
to `bootc install` the image ref the user picked in the macOS app. The catalog
is just registry refs (`bonito:gnome-asahi`, …), so a new variant needs no
installer change — but a ref **must** pass the Asahi golden-manifest harness
before it is offered, and "appears without touching the installer" must never
be read as "appears without being verified."

As of 2026-07-30 only `bonito` and `grouper` pass (36/36 each); the other six
promoted `*-asahi` tags would leave a Mac unbootable
([tunaOS#776](https://github.com/tuna-os/tunaOS/issues/776)). The catalog
is an explicit allowlist: every `CatalogEntry` carries a `verified` field
(`false` by default), and the macOS app only offers entries where it is
`true`. The shipped `catalog.json` includes both `bonito` and `grouper`,
marked `verified: true`. Adding a new variant requires both the image and a
passing harness sweep — the field is the gate, and CI generation must
consume harness results, not just tag enumeration
([#41](https://github.com/tuna-os/bootc-installer-asahi/issues/41)).

## Status

- [x] Design (docs/DESIGN.md)
- [x] D0 scaffold: `scripts/make-payload.sh` + `build-payload.yml` — package
      any asahi-capable bootc image as an asahi-installer zip +
      `installer_data.json` (wired with R2 upload step for `download.tunaos.org/asahi`)
- [x] D0 validated against a real asahi image (`bonito:gnome-asahi`, tunaOS#774)
- [x] D1 first-boot fisherman agent config (`install-config.json` → unattended `bootc install`)
- [x] D2 asahi-installer `--json` machine mode (upstreamable)
- [ ] D3 macOS app (SwiftUI, wraps the asahi-installer Python backend)
- [x] D4 recoveryOS walkthrough UX, LUKS, Wi-Fi handoff (RecoveryWalkthroughView QR & instructions; LUKS fail-closed #20/#47; Wi-Fi prompt at first boot #46)

### What's tested and what it proves

The project distinguishes two claims that are easy to conflate (see #27):

| Claim | Test | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| **"A payload boots"** | `test-payload.sh` + `test-boot-payload.sh` | The kernel, DTBs, modules, and U-Boot EFI chain work. Any asahi-capable image passes this — it proves the *packaging*, not the *product*. |
| **"The bootstrap handoff is green"** | `test-agent.sh` + `test-agent-disk.sh` + `test-agent-install.sh` | The agent generates a valid recipe, the recipe passes real fisherman `validate`, and a real `bootc install` succeeds end-to-end (canaries on ESP / neighbour / bootstrap / target). |
| **"The bootstrap image contains everything it needs"** | `test-bootstrap-contents.sh` | Static verification: bootsahi-agent, enabled unit, fisherman, cosign, jq, nmcli, blkid — all present and accounted for. Also gates a negative fixture (agent removed → must fail). |
| **"The actual bootstrap image boots"** | `test-bootstrap-boot.sh` (opt-in) | Build, package, and boot the repo's own bootstrap under qemu+U-Boot. The deepest fidelity achievable without Apple hardware. Needs aarch64 + qemu + u-boot-qemu. |

Payload layout & `installer_data.json` schema modeled on
fedora-asahi kiwi-descriptions and
[nixos-asahi-package](https://github.com/quinneden/nixos-asahi-package).
M1/M2 only — M3+ has no Asahi installer support yet.
