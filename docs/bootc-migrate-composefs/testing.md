How this project stays trustworthy: what runs where, what gates what, and
what is automated so humans don't have to remember it. Companion to
ROADMAP.md (what we're building) and docs/cfs-cli-generations.md (the
evidence-gathering method this strategy grew out of).

## The pyramid

| Layer | What | Where it runs | Budget |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | Pure logic: parsers, planners, mergetc tables, routing, digest handling, probe classification | `just test` / CI `validate`, every push | seconds |
| Feature-matrix | Same, with every cargo feature on (`composefs-native` is invisible to the default build) | `just test-all-features` (part of `just check`) | seconds |
| Integration (host) | Real repositories on loopback filesystems, real podman probes of real images — no VM | developer machines + scheduled canary | minutes |
| E2E (VM) | Full migrations in QEMU: partition → install → migrate → reboot → assert | e2e-tests.yml matrix, PR-gated via `e2e-gate` | ~30 min/cell |

Rules of thumb:

- **Logic goes down the pyramid.** If a behavior can be tested without a VM
  (extract a pure function, fabricate store contents through public APIs,
  feed fixture bytes), it must be. The E2E cells exist to catch what only a
  real boot can: initrd behavior, bootloader handoff, mount namespaces,
  systemd ordering.
- **A failed E2E cell must name its phase.** The harness (`tests/run-e2e.sh`)
  prints `=== Phase N ===` banners and asserts with `FAIL:` prefixes so logs
  are greppable (`just e2e-failures`).
- **Evidence over inference.** When upstream behavior is in question, build
  the experiment (loopback verity store, container probes) before designing
  around an assumption — docs/cfs-cli-generations.md is the worked example.

## E2E matrix: current and planned

Current (the four **untouchable MVP regression gates** + M1 addition):

| Cell | Proves | Status |
|---|---|---|
| bluefin stable → dakota (btrfs) | new-gen host path: probe → delegation ladder → builder | active |
| bluefin LTS → dakota (ext4) | legacy fast path, ext4 fs-verity | active |
| bluefin LTS → dakota (xfs+LUKS) | loopback store, passphrase injection | active |
| bluefin LTS → dakota (xfs+LVM+LUKS, split /var) | worst-case storage stack | active |
| bluefin stable → bluefin gts (ostree-rebase mode) | OstreeDeploy strategy + rollback presence | PR #69/#70 |

Planned, one per milestone exit (see ROADMAP.md):

- **M1**: dakota → dakota:other-tag (`ImageSwap`, `E2E_MODE=image-swap`)
- **M2**: ostree-rebase cell + `--bootloader systemd-boot` + simulated
  kernel update asserting ESP resync; `--undo` restores GRUB
- **M3**: fedora-family → centos-family with populated /var (ownership,
  remap report, `.rebase-old` sidecars)
- **M4**: a migration where **no** legacy-CLI bootc exists (NativeStore
  writer); kernel-version gate ≥6.12 for file-backed EROFS mounts
- **M0**: rollback cell — migrate, boot, `rollback`, assert the OSTree
  deployment boots and the store is intact (#22/#26); greenboot-compatible
  health scripts asserted present

Cell design rules: new capability ⇒ new cell (never widen an MVP cell);
prefer `E2E_MODE` branches in one harness over new harnesses; every cell
must be runnable locally (`just e2e*` with env overrides).

## Narrow dispatch (implemented)

`e2e-single.yml` dispatches exactly one cell with chosen parameters:

    gh workflow run e2e-single.yml -f filesystem=btrfs -f mode=composefs-migrate

One failing scenario gets iterated alone instead of burning the whole
matrix per attempt — the contract the ci-fix-loop practice expects. (A
matrix-filter `if` was rejected: the `matrix` context is not available in
job-level `if`, a bug actionlint caught before it shipped.) Keep its step
sequence in sync with e2e-tests.yml.

## Coverage floor (implemented)

CI's `coverage` job runs `cargo llvm-cov --workspace --all-features` with
a **regression floor** (`--fail-under-lines`, see `just coverage-check`)
and posts the summary to the job summary. The floor is not a target — it
exists to catch commits that delete or bypass meaningful coverage. Raise
it as milestones add tests; never lower it to merge. Local:
`just coverage` / `coverage-html`. Baseline 2026-07-19: ~27% lines, with
the pure-logic modules at 75–100% and the deliberately-untested layers
(process orchestration, TUI, network/filesystem effectors) at 0 — those
are the E2E cells' job.

## Failure triage (implemented)

Both E2E workflows write a triage block to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` on
failure: last phase banner reached, every `FAIL:`/`ERROR:` assertion, and
the log tail — diagnosis starts from the annotation, not a log download.

## Upstream drift canary (implemented)

`.github/workflows/upstream-drift-canary.yml` runs twice weekly (and on
dispatch): `tests/drift-canary.sh` probes every image in
`tests/canary-baseline.tsv` for its cfs CLI generation and exits 1 on
drift (auto-filing/updating a canary issue), 2 on probe-infra failure
(retried next run, never alerted). The #72 breakage is exactly what this
catches; **the pinned legacy builder drifting to new-gen is the critical
alert** — it breaks the delegation ladder and blocks the MVP.

Maintaining the baseline: when a drift is real and absorbed (code adapted,
docs updated), update `canary-baseline.tsv` in the same PR that absorbs it.

## Flake policy & known gotchas

- **Retry taxonomy**: GHCR connection-resets and ENOSPC during image pull
  are infra flakes (rerun the cell via narrow dispatch); assertion failures
  and phase errors are never rerun without a diagnosis.
- **`gh run rerun` reuses the run's original merge commit.** If main moved
  since (e.g. a harness fix landed), rerunning tests stale code — merge
  main into the PR branch instead. This has bitten before.
- **Cancelled runs surface as `fail`** in `gh pr checks`; a stuck-queued
  workflow sometimes needs cancel + rerun to re-enter the queue.
- **Disk sizing is part of the test.** ENOSPC inside the guest shows up as
  misleading downstream errors (including probe misfires — see the probe
  asymmetry note in CONTEXT.md). Cells document their disk_size rationale
  inline in e2e-tests.yml.
- **Mount errors on new-gen hosts are expected noise** in phases 4/5 until
  PR #76 lands (podman fallbacks carry the migration) — don't read them as
  the failure signal.
- **The LVM-on-LUKS cell is the disk-tightest one** (60G, BIOS-boot + ESP +
  separate /boot + fixed 4G /var LV before root sees anything) — an ENOSPC
  there is the flake class to suspect first, not a regression.

### Incident: `required-checks` didn't actually gate on `e2e-gate`

PR #73 auto-merged 2026-07-19 while its E2E run showed one cell failing
(the LVM-on-LUKS ENOSPC flake above). Root cause: `required-checks` — the
one job branch protection watches — listed `[validate, cargo-deny,
coverage, actionlint]` in its `needs`, never `e2e-gate`. The two jobs were
siblings, not a chain, since the workflow's original introduction — this
predates every change in this document. `required-checks` passed on the
fast jobs alone while `e2e-gate` independently failed, and GitHub had no
reason to block the merge.

Fixed by adding `e2e-gate` to `required-checks`' `needs`. The rule going
forward: **`required-checks` is the merge gate, so every other gate must
feed into it** — a new CI job that isn't in that `needs` list is invisible
to branch protection no matter how good the job itself is. (The merge
itself needed no revert: the fix under test was validated by the other
three cells, including the critical btrfs one, and the ENOSPC failure was
the known flake class above.)

## Local reproduction

- `just check` — everything CI's validate job runs, now including the
  feature matrix (`test-all-features`).
- `just e2e` / `e2e-lts` / `e2e-luks` / `e2e-lvm` — full cells locally;
  `e2e-status`, `e2e-ssh`, `e2e-tail`, `e2e-scan`, `e2e-reboot-test` for
  surgical iteration on a phase.
- `just drift-canary` — the upstream probe, sans CI.
- Cross-generation store experiments: reproduction commands in
  docs/cfs-cli-generations.md §Reproducing (needs a `mkfs.ext4 -O verity`
  loopback; root filesystems commonly lack the verity feature).

## Gaps / next automation (tracked, not yet built)

1. **Store-level integration test in CI**: the loopback cross-gen check
   (legacy write → new-gen fsck) as a cheap weekly job — no VM, ~2 GB.
2. **Nightly `cargo update --dry-run` + composefs-rs version watch** —
   surfacing new 0.x releases early (NativeStore pins 0.7).
3. **Merge-queue discipline**: once the stacked fleet lands, enable GitHub
   merge queue with `required-checks` as the single required context (it
   already tolerates skipped optional jobs).
