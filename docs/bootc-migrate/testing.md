How this project stays trustworthy: what runs where, what gates what, and
what is automated so humans don't have to remember it. Companion to
ROADMAP.md (what we're building) and docs/cfs-cli-generations.md (the
evidence-gathering method this strategy grew out of).

## The pyramid

| Layer | What | Where it runs | Budget |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | Pure logic: parsers, planners, mergetc tables, routing, digest handling, probe classification | `just test` / CI `validate`, every push | seconds |
| Feature-matrix | Same, with every cargo feature on (`composefs-native` is invisible to the default build) | `just test-all-features` (part of `just check`) | seconds |
| Integration (host) | Real repositories on loopback filesystems, real podman probes of real images — no VM | developer machines + scheduled canary | minutes |
| E2E (VM) | Full migrations in QEMU: partition → install → migrate → reboot → assert | e2e-tests.yml matrix, PR-gated via `e2e-gate` | ~30 min/cell |

Rules of thumb:

- **Logic goes down the pyramid.** If a behavior can be tested without a VM
  (extract a pure function, fabricate store contents through public APIs,
  feed fixture bytes), it must be. The E2E cells exist to catch what only a
  real boot can: initrd behavior, bootloader handoff, mount namespaces,
  systemd ordering.
- **A failed E2E cell must name its phase.** The harness (`tests/run-e2e.sh`)
  prints `=== Phase N ===` banners and asserts with `FAIL:` prefixes so logs
  are greppable (`just e2e-failures`).
- **Evidence over inference.** When upstream behavior is in question, build
  the experiment (loopback verity store, container probes) before designing
  around an assumption — docs/cfs-cli-generations.md is the worked example.

## E2E matrix: current and planned

Current (the four **untouchable MVP regression gates** + M1 addition):

| Cell | Proves | Status |
|---|---|---|
| bluefin stable → dakota (btrfs) | new-gen host path: probe → delegation ladder → builder | active |
| bluefin LTS → dakota (ext4) | legacy fast path, ext4 fs-verity | active |
| bluefin LTS → dakota (xfs+LUKS) | loopback store, passphrase injection | active |
| bluefin LTS → dakota (xfs+LVM+LUKS, split /var) | worst-case storage stack | active |
| bluefin stable → bluefin gts (ostree-rebase mode) | OstreeDeploy strategy + rollback presence | PR #69/#70 |
| bluefin stable → aurora (ostree-rebase mode) | cross-DE native `/etc` merge probe (#80) | active, non-gating |
| bluefin stable → dakota (tui-migrate mode) | TUI wizard + Config Drift Review event loops on a pty (`tests/tui-e2e-driver.py`), then the full composefs pipeline + all default-mode assertions | active, gating |

### Cross-base mode (`E2E_CROSS_BASE=1`) — mechanism ready, blocked

`ostree-rebase` mode takes `E2E_CROSS_BASE=1`, which adds
`--accept-cross-base` (the route is refused without it) and asserts that
`=== Cross-base UID/GID remap report ===` appeared in the output.

The assertion is the point. `gate_cross_base` returns `None` and prints
nothing whenever it declines to act, so silence is indistinguishable from
success and an unasserted cell would pass vacuously.

**There is still no matrix cell using it** (#187), but the blocker is now
identified and it is *not* what this file previously claimed.

The diagnostic below produced its first real output on 2026-08-28:

```
could not reach registry ghcr.io
  (https: token fetch failed: curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 403
 ; http: unexpected status from http://ghcr.io/v2/: 301)
```

ghcr.io **is** reachable from the guest. The `http` attempt got ghcr.io's
redirect to HTTPS; the `https` attempt got a `401` challenge, parsed it, and
requested a token — and that token request returned **403**. So `curl` is
present, DNS resolves, TLS works, and `/v2/` round-trips. What fails is
specifically `fetch_bearer_token`.

This file previously said the scan "cannot reach ghcr.io", which sent
investigations toward guest networking. That was wrong. It also explains why
`bootc switch` pulls fine moments later: containers/image builds its token
request differently — never evidence about connectivity, only that our token
request is malformed in a way bootc's is not.

A 403 (not a 401) from the token endpoint points at a malformed or
over-scoped request: scope construction (`repository:<owner>/<name>:pull`),
a synthesized `service` parameter, or header expectations ghcr.io enforces
more strictly than Docker Hub. Tracked on #187.

Two things were fixed to make that blocker diagnosable rather than merely
observed:

- `RegistryEndpoint::resolve` used to `continue` past each scheme's error and
  report a single opaque `could not reach registry ghcr.io (tried
  ["https","http"])`. Curl-not-installed, DNS failure, a TLS rejection, a
  proxy's 403 and a 401 with no challenge all looked identical — which is
  exactly the information needed to fix any of them. It now reports what each
  scheme actually did.
- The scan retry was 3 attempts at a flat 2s, covering only ~4s of a guest's
  network coming up. It is now 4 attempts with exponential backoff (~14s), and
  a non-retryable failure (a missing `curl`) returns immediately instead of
  burning the window and reporting itself as "after N attempts", which reads
  like a network fault.

The `ostree-rebase` path also probes the guest's registry reachability
directly (`[registry-probe]` lines: whether `curl` exists, what
`https://ghcr.io/v2/` returns, and `/etc/resolv.conf`), so the next run of any
ostree-rebase cell reports the true cause rather than leaving it to inference.

That same scan failure is why **every `ostree-rebase` cell passes
`--accept-cross-base`**. Since #191 an unscannable target is a refusal rather
than a silent proceed, so the harness — which knows its image pairs are
same-lineage Fedora — has to opt in explicitly, exactly as a human operator
would. The cells assert the refusal *first*, without the flag, so the gate's
wiring has live coverage and cannot regress to waving things through.

### The matrix already has a cross-base pair

With the scan working, `is_cross_base` was evaluated for the first time —
and `bluefin:stable → dakota:stable` **is** cross-base. From the gating
ostree re-base cell:

```
=== Cross-base UID/GID remap report ===
Diverging system accounts (renumbered during the re-base):
  wheel                    gid 10 -> 997
2 chown pass(es) will run over /var and preserved /etc.
Error: Cross-base re-base detected (host and target disagree on ID/ID_LIKE).
```

This also corrects a second standing assumption. These pairs were described
here as "same-lineage Fedora", and the worry was that a cross-base cell would
need an exotic image because `is_cross_base` is lineage-aware and CentOS
declares `ID_LIKE="rhel fedora"`. Neither the pessimism nor the premise
survived contact: the existing pair qualifies.

So #187 does not need a dedicated matrix cell. The gating `ostree-rebase`
cell now asserts, after opting in with `--accept-cross-base`, that the remap
report actually appears — the cross-base path executing under assertion,
which is what the issue asks for. `E2E_CROSS_BASE=1` remains available for
forcing the check on a pair chosen deliberately.

### Desktop migration (`E2E_DE_MIGRATE=1`) — active on the cross-DE cell

The `bluefin -> aurora` cell (GNOME → KDE) now passes `--de-migrate`. Before
this, no cell passed it, so the controller reported "skipped (--de-migrate not
passed)" and #68's stash/restore code never ran — the cell exercised the
re-base route while proving nothing about desktop migration.

The harness seeds a GNOME config for the first human account, then asserts
both that a cross-desktop plan was reported *and* that
`~/.local/share/de-migrate` exists afterwards. The second half matters: a plan
without a stash is precisely #68's unshipped half. Like the cross-base
assertion, the failure branches name which of the four silent causes occurred
(flag not wired, same desktop, no human users, or target scan failed) rather
than guessing one.

Because desktop detection scans the target image, this cell depends on the
same registry path as `E2E_CROSS_BASE`, and is blocked by the same 403 on the
token fetch described above.

### Boot entries (`E2E_BOOT_ENTRIES=1`) — live NVRAM coverage

The gating `bluefin ostree re-base` cell now runs `boot-entries`: a read-only
`--json` audit, then a `--rename-branding --apply --yes` followed by `--undo`,
asserting that `efibootmgr -v` output is byte-identical before and after.

This is the first cell to mutate real UEFI NVRAM (#189). Until it existed,
#31's `efibootmgr` executor had only unit tests of the *plan*; the write path
and the snapshot-restore path had never run against real firmware variables.

**Scope limit:** #189 also names #65's live bootloader flip. That is *not*
covered and cannot be — `migrate-bootloader` currently bails with "not
implemented yet (issue #65)", so there is no flip to exercise.

Planned, one per milestone exit (see ROADMAP.md):

- **M1**: dakota → dakota:other-tag (`ImageSwap`, `E2E_MODE=image-swap`)
- **M2**: ostree-rebase cell + `--bootloader systemd-boot` + simulated
  kernel update asserting ESP resync; `--undo` restores GRUB
- **M3**: the cross-base cell above covers centos-family → fedora-family.
  The exit criterion names the *other* direction (fedora → centos), which
  needs a CentOS-family target image the harness does not currently install;
  decide explicitly whether direction matters (#187)
- **M4**: a migration where **no** legacy-CLI bootc exists (NativeStore
  writer); kernel-version gate ≥6.12 for file-backed EROFS mounts
- **M0**: rollback cell — migrate, boot, `rollback`, assert the OSTree
  deployment boots and the store is intact (#22/#26); greenboot-compatible
  health scripts asserted present

Cell design rules: new capability ⇒ new cell (never widen an MVP cell);
prefer `E2E_MODE` branches in one harness over new harnesses; every cell
must be runnable locally (`just e2e*` with env overrides).

## TUI testing (three layers)

Interactive code splits the same way the rest of the project does —
pure logic proven cheap, live behavior proven on a real system:

1. **State machines + rendering, headless**: every checklist/wizard's key
   handling is a pure function (`handle_key`) and every frame draws into
   ratatui's `TestBackend` for content assertions — `tui::tests` and
   `drift_review::tests` in `bootc-migrate`, `boot_entry_review::tests`
   in `bootc-rebase`. Runs in `cargo test`, no terminal involved.
2. **The raw terminal event loop, in the VM**: `tests/tui-e2e-driver.py`
   (stdlib-only python3, runs on the system under test) spawns the TUI on
   a pty, reconstructs the screen from the emitted escape sequences, and
   types like a human. The `tui-migrate` cell uses it to drive
   `etc-drift --interactive` and then a full migration through the
   wizard; two hard-won rules live in its docstring — match against a
   grid, never the raw stream (ratatui diff-draws), and never type while
   a forced-repaint winsize nudge is in flight (the key gets dropped).

   The cell also documents itself: the driver records each flow as an
   asciicast v2 file (`--record`) and saves a plain-text screenshot of
   every wizard screen it reaches (`--snapshot-dir`). CI renders the
   casts into timelapse GIFs with `agg` (long quiet phases collapsed via
   `--idle-time-limit`) and publishes casts + GIFs + screenshots as the
   `tui-walkthrough` artifact on every tui-migrate run, pass or fail —
   the automated successor to the manual vhs capture in
   `scripts/capture-screenshots.sh`. Replay a cast locally with
   `asciinema play tui-migrate.cast` or re-render with
   `agg tui-migrate.cast out.gif`.
3. **Exploratory, by hand**: Corral VMs (AGENTS.md), for anything the
   scripted flow doesn't reach (resize behavior, colors, feel).

The driver self-tests on any non-OSTree dev box — the wizard runs to the
Failed screen and must exit cleanly:

    cargo build
    python3 tests/tui-e2e-driver.py --mode wizard-expect-failure \
      --binary target/debug/bootc-migrate --target-image quay.io/x/y:z

## KVM runner options

The whole E2E matrix needs `/dev/kvm` (TCG is ~10× slower and blows any
sane timeout). **GitHub-hosted Linux runners provide it** — measured
2026-08-27, `crw-rw-rw- root:kvm`, guest SSH in 31 seconds — so
`ubuntu-latest` is the default and no variable is needed to turn the
matrix on. The long-standing "hosted runners have no KVM" note in these
workflows predated GitHub enabling it and was simply stale.

One hosted-runner adjustment is required and lives in both workflows:
the runner image's podman config leaves `Native Overlay Diff: "false"`,
which makes every `podman build` layer commit walk and compare the whole
~10 GB bluefin rootfs — about **30 minutes per trivial `RUN`**, enough
to burn a 45-minute budget before QEMU ever starts. The `Use native
overlay diffs for podman` step writes a minimal `/etc/containers/
storage.conf` and resets the still-empty graph, cutting the full image
bake to ~8 minutes. It is skipped when `E2E_SELF_HOSTED=true`, because
that host owns its storage config and its graph holds cached images.

Runner selection, highest precedence first:

1. **`E2E_RUNSON_SPEC` set** → [RunsOn](https://runs-on.com) ephemeral
   EC2 runners in your own AWS account (useful for more cores than a
   hosted runner's 4, or when hosted capacity is contended). Install the
   RunsOn GitHub App and deploy its CloudFormation stack **including the
   nested launch templates** (an existing stack must be upgraded before
   `nested-virt` jobs run — plain EC2 VMs have no nested virtualization,
   so this is what exposes `/dev/kvm` without paying for `.metal`), then
   set:

       E2E_RUNSON_SPEC=family=c8i+m8i+r8i/cpu=8/ram=32/volume=120gb/nested-virt/image=ubuntu24-full-x64/spot=false

   The workflows prepend the `runs-on=<run-id>` routing key RunsOn
   requires; everything after it is yours to tune without touching
   workflow YAML. Constraints worth keeping: `nested-virt` needs an x64
   image on a supported family (c8i/m8i/r8i); `volume=120gb` covers the
   60G sparse guest disk plus both ~5 GB images and the Rust target;
   `spot=false` (or `retry=when-interrupted`) because a 30-90-minute
   cell is a bad spot candidate.
2. **`E2E_SELF_HOSTED=true`** → the `kvm`-labelled self-hosted host
   (kanpur), the original setup.
3. **Neither** → `ubuntu-latest`.

`KVM_E2E_ENABLED` is now a **kill switch, not an enable switch**: set it
to `'false'` to stand the whole matrix down (`e2e-gate` treats a skipped
run as a trivial pass); unset or `'true'` both run. Switching lanes is a
variable change, never a workflow edit.

### Timeouts, and why they are what they are

| Budget | Value | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Per-cell job timeout | 90 min | The tui-migrate cell measured 65 min end to end (image bake + migration + reboot + rollback + commit, driven through the wizard). |
| `e2e-gate` wait window (ci.yml) | 100 min | Must clear the job timeout plus queue time. It was 50 min while the matrix was gated off; leaving it there would have failed every PR the moment the matrix started gating. |

Measured cell runtimes on `ubuntu-latest` (2026-08-27): ostree-rebase-plan
26 min, composefs-migrate 36 min, tui-migrate 65 min. The `Enable KVM
access` step probes `/dev/kvm` and warns rather than failing, so a runner
without it degrades loudly — a cell that suddenly takes hours is that
warning going unread.

## Narrow dispatch (implemented)

`e2e-single.yml` dispatches exactly one cell with chosen parameters:

    gh workflow run e2e-single.yml -f filesystem=btrfs -f mode=composefs-migrate

One failing scenario gets iterated alone instead of burning the whole
matrix per attempt — the contract the ci-fix-loop practice expects. (A
matrix-filter `if` was rejected: the `matrix` context is not available in
job-level `if`, a bug actionlint caught before it shipped.) Keep its step
sequence in sync with e2e-tests.yml.

## Coverage floor (implemented)

CI's `coverage` job runs `cargo llvm-cov --workspace --all-features` with
a **regression floor** (`--fail-under-lines`, see `just coverage-check`)
and posts the summary to the job summary. The floor is not a target — it
exists to catch commits that delete or bypass meaningful coverage. Raise
it as milestones add tests; never lower it to merge. Local:
`just coverage` / `coverage-html`. Baseline 2026-07-19: ~27% lines, with
the pure-logic modules at 75–100% and the deliberately-untested layers
(process orchestration, TUI, network/filesystem effectors) at 0 — those
are the E2E cells' job.

## Failure triage (implemented)

Both E2E workflows write a triage block to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` on
failure: last phase banner reached, every `FAIL:`/`ERROR:` assertion, and
the log tail — diagnosis starts from the annotation, not a log download.

## Upstream drift canary (implemented)

`.github/workflows/upstream-drift-canary.yml` runs twice weekly (and on
dispatch): `tests/drift-canary.sh` probes every image in
`tests/canary-baseline.tsv` for its cfs CLI generation and exits 1 on
drift (auto-filing/updating a canary issue), 2 on probe-infra failure
(retried next run, never alerted). The #72 breakage is exactly what this
catches; **the pinned legacy builder drifting to new-gen is the critical
alert** — it breaks the delegation ladder and blocks the MVP.

Maintaining the baseline: when a drift is real and absorbed (code adapted,
docs updated), update `canary-baseline.tsv` in the same PR that absorbs it.

## Flake policy & known gotchas

- **Retry taxonomy**: GHCR connection-resets and ENOSPC during image pull
  are infra flakes (rerun the cell via narrow dispatch); assertion failures
  and phase errors are never rerun without a diagnosis.
- **`gh run rerun` reuses the run's original merge commit.** If main moved
  since (e.g. a harness fix landed), rerunning tests stale code — merge
  main into the PR branch instead. This has bitten before.
- **Cancelled runs surface as `fail`** in `gh pr checks`; a stuck-queued
  workflow sometimes needs cancel + rerun to re-enter the queue.
- **Disk sizing is part of the test.** ENOSPC inside the guest shows up as
  misleading downstream errors (including probe misfires — see the probe
  asymmetry note in CONTEXT.md). Cells document their disk_size rationale
  inline in e2e-tests.yml.
- **Mount errors on new-gen hosts are expected noise** in phases 4/5 until
  PR #76 lands (podman fallbacks carry the migration) — don't read them as
  the failure signal.
- **The LVM-on-LUKS cell is the disk-tightest one** (60G, BIOS-boot + ESP +
  separate /boot + fixed 4G /var LV before root sees anything) — an ENOSPC
  there is the flake class to suspect first, not a regression.

### Incident: `required-checks` didn't actually gate on `e2e-gate`

PR #73 auto-merged 2026-07-19 while its E2E run showed one cell failing
(the LVM-on-LUKS ENOSPC flake above). Root cause: `required-checks` — the
one job branch protection watches — listed `[validate, cargo-deny,
coverage, actionlint]` in its `needs`, never `e2e-gate`. The two jobs were
siblings, not a chain, since the workflow's original introduction — this
predates every change in this document. `required-checks` passed on the
fast jobs alone while `e2e-gate` independently failed, and GitHub had no
reason to block the merge.

Fixed by adding `e2e-gate` to `required-checks`' `needs`. The rule going
forward: **`required-checks` is the merge gate, so every other gate must
feed into it** — a new CI job that isn't in that `needs` list is invisible
to branch protection no matter how good the job itself is. (The merge
itself needed no revert: the fix under test was validated by the other
three cells, including the critical btrfs one, and the ENOSPC failure was
the known flake class above.)

## Local reproduction

- `just check` — everything CI's validate job runs, now including the
  feature matrix (`test-all-features`).
- `just e2e` / `e2e-lts` / `e2e-luks` / `e2e-lvm` — full cells locally;
  `e2e-status`, `e2e-ssh`, `e2e-tail`, `e2e-scan`, `e2e-reboot-test` for
  surgical iteration on a phase.
- `just drift-canary` — the upstream probe, sans CI.
- Cross-generation store experiments: reproduction commands in
  docs/cfs-cli-generations.md §Reproducing (needs a `mkfs.ext4 -O verity`
  loopback; root filesystems commonly lack the verity feature).

## Gaps / next automation (tracked, not yet built)

1. **Store-level integration test in CI**: the loopback cross-gen check
   (legacy write → new-gen fsck) as a cheap weekly job — no VM, ~2 GB.
2. **Nightly `cargo update --dry-run` + composefs-rs version watch** —
   surfacing new 0.x releases early (NativeStore pins 0.7).
3. **Merge-queue discipline**: once the stacked fleet lands, enable GitHub
   merge queue with `required-checks` as the single required context (it
   already tolerates skipped optional jobs).
