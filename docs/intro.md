# Welcome to TunaOS

## A Collection of Cloud-Native Enterprise Linux OS Images

TunaOS is a curated collection of **Bootc-based desktop operating systems** that are forks of [Bluefin LTS](https://github.com/ublue-os/bluefin-lts), built on modern container technology. This is an exploration of the flexibility of Bootc and a hope that some people believe in the Enterprise Linux Desktop.

The plan is to provide a stable experience with up-to-date GNOME and modern tooling.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Latest GNOME**: Don't get stuck on a 3-year-old GNOME. We try to backport the latest Desktop features and bring them to the Enterprise Desktop
  - Currently we're shipping GNOME `48.3` while EL will be stuck on GNOME `47` for the foreseeable future
- **Anaconda WebUI & Live ISO**: Modern installation experience (pending upstream)
- **Homebrew**: We bake Homebrew into the image, so all your CLI apps (and fonts) are just a brew command away
- **Flathub by Default**: This is a no-brainer that isn't preset in our base images. Actually get all the Flatpaks that are generally available on the net

## üê† Available Variants

We ship 3 versions for each base, matching upstream:

- **Regular**: See [Bluefin's excellent documentation](https://docs.projectbluefin.io/) for info
- **DX (Developer Experience)**: Adding libvirt, Docker, VSCode, etc. [Learn more](https://docs.projectbluefin.io/dx)
- **GDX (Graphical Developer Experience)**: Adding Nvidia drivers and CUDA. For Nvidia users/AI/VFX devs. [Learn more](https://docs.projectbluefin.io/gdx)

### Images Available

- **[Albacore](albacore)** - AlmaLinux 10 based
- **[Yellowfin](yellowfin)** - AlmaLinux Kitten 10 based (closest to upstream Bluefin LTS)
- **[Bonito](bonito)** - Fedora 42 based (cutting-edge)
- **[Skipjack](skipjack)** - CentOS 10 based
