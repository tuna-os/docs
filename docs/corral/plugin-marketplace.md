Corral plugins are standalone `corral-<name>` executables. The marketplace is
discovery and verified delivery; it does not load third-party code into the
main Corral process.

## Authoring contract

- Name the executable `corral-<name>`, where the name matches
  `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,62}$`.
- Take normal arguments directly from the command line. Corral connects stdin/stdout/stderr and
  returns the plugin process's exit status. Human output belongs on stdout;
  diagnostics belong on stderr.
- Read `CORRAL_PLUGIN` when behavior depends on the dispatched name. Honor the
  same `CORRAL_KUBE_CONTEXT`, `CORRAL_INCUS_REMOTE`, and
  `CORRAL_LIBVIRT_URI` one-shot context variables as core commands. Never
  switch kubectl, Incus, or libvirt global state.
- Support `--corral-plugin-metadata`. It must print a single JSON object with
  API `corral.plugin/v1`, then exit successfully and do no other work. Go
  plugins can call `sdk.HandleMetadata` before they construct their command.
- Treat capabilities and permissions as declarations, not authorization.
  Corral asks for install consent; the plugin must still use least-privilege
  credentials and rely on Kubernetes, filesystem, and network enforcement.
- Declare `supportedBackends` using `qemu`, `kubevirt`, `incus`, `libvirt`, or
  `all`. Reject a selected backend before mutation when it is not supported;
  do not silently fall back to another context.

Minimal Go entry point:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"

    "github.com/tuna-os/corral/pkg/plugin/sdk"
)

func main() {
    if sdk.HandleMetadata(sdk.Metadata{
        Name: "hello", Version: "1.0.0",
        Capabilities: []string{"cli-command"},
        Permissions: []string{"read Corral configuration"},
        SupportedBackends: []string{"all"},
    }) { return }
    fmt.Fprintln(os.Stdout, "hello from Corral")
}
```

Test the binary directly, test the metadata handshake, then test dispatch with
`CORRAL_PLUGIN_DIR=/path/to/bin corral hello`. Plugins should not import
`cmd`; reusable behavior for a backend belongs in a `pkg/` package.

## External marketplace

1. Build immutable binaries for each advertised platform.
2. Publish them at HTTPS URLs that you never replace.
3. Create an index that conforms to `marketplace/schema-v2.json`. Every artifact
   needs its SHA-256 digest. Publishers may also sign the lowercase
   digest with Ed25519 and publish the base64 public key.
4. Validate it with `corral marketplace validate index.json`.
5. Host the index over HTTPS and test it with
   `corral marketplace add <source> <url>`.

Corral accepts only an index that declares
`"schemaVersion": "corral.marketplace/v2"`. Corral rejects an index without
that declaration, because it has no publisher, no license, and no digest. An
operator who accepts that danger can add the source with
`corral marketplace add <source> <url> --allow-unverified`. Corral then prints
a warning when it reads the index and again at install time, and
`corral marketplace list` shows the source as `unverified`.

To select a plugin with a duplicate name, use `source/name`. Installation
shows the publisher and the requested permissions, and it needs explicit
consent to those permissions. Corral verifies compatibility, digest, and any
supplied signature before it atomically replaces an installed plugin; failed state writes roll the
binary back.

## Recommended CI

Build from a version tag, run the plugin's tests, generate checksums, validate
the index, and publish both artifacts and index in one immutable release. The
repository's `scripts/generate-marketplace.sh` and `publish-plugins` workflow
are a reference that works.

## First-party plugins

[first-party-plugins.md](https://github.com/tuna-os/corral/blob/main/docs/first-party-plugins.md) documents the maintained
catalog and its maturity. First-party means published
by tuna-os through the curated marketplace; it does not grant the plugin more
runtime privilege than an external plugin.
