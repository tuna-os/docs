This document outlines the split between standard core features and automated enhancements in `bluefin-cli`.

## 📦 Binary Versions

You can build two versions of the CLI:
1.  **`bluefin-cli` (Standard)**: The standard tool for management.
2.  **`bluefin-cli-plus` (Plus)**: The enhanced version with deep automation.

## 🍦 Standard Features
These features are included in **both** binaries. They focus on providing tools and resources while leaving final configuration to the user.

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Build Tags
We use Go **build tags** to gate "Extra" logic. 
- Files marked with `//go:build extra` are excluded from the standard standard build.
- This ensures the standard binary remains lean and focused on core tasks.

### Dynamic UI
The interactive `bluefin-cli menu` automatically detects which features are compiled in and adjusts its options accordingly, hiding headers and commands that aren't available in the current binary.
