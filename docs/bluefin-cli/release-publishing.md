GoReleaser publishes the Homebrew formula to
[`tuna-os/homebrew-tap`](https://github.com/tuna-os/homebrew-tap). The release
workflow passes the repository secret `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` to GoReleaser, and
`.goreleaser.yaml` skips the formula upload when that variable is empty.

## One-time administrator setup

An organization administrator should create a fine-grained GitHub token with:

- repository access restricted to `tuna-os/homebrew-tap`;
- repository permission `Contents: Read and write`.

Store the token in the `tuna-os/bluefin-cli` repository as the Actions secret
named exactly:

```text
HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN
```

The token must belong to an account that can push to the tap's `main` branch.
Do not put it in the workflow file, `.goreleaser.yaml`, or a fork.

## Verification

After adding the secret, trigger a release from a release tag and check the
GoReleaser output for the Homebrew publisher. The generated formula should land
in `tuna-os/homebrew-tap` under `Formula/` on `main`.

Without the secret, releases intentionally remain green and publish the other
configured channels; the Homebrew publisher is skipped. This makes the setting
safe to test in forks and pull requests without exposing or requiring the
organization credential.

## Scoop

GoReleaser publishes the Windows Scoop manifest to
[`tuna-os/scoop-bucket`](https://github.com/tuna-os/scoop-bucket). The release
workflow passes the repository secret `SCOOP_BUCKET_TOKEN` to GoReleaser, and
`.goreleaser.yaml` skips the Scoop upload when that variable is empty.

## One-time administrator setup

An organization administrator should create a fine-grained GitHub token with:

- repository access restricted to `tuna-os/scoop-bucket`;
- repository permission `Contents: Read and write`.

Store the token in the `tuna-os/bluefin-cli` repository as the Actions secret
named exactly:

```text
SCOOP_BUCKET_TOKEN
```

The token must belong to an account that can push to the bucket's `main`
branch. Do not put it in the workflow file, `.goreleaser.yaml`, or a fork.

After adding the secret, trigger a release from a release tag and check the
GoReleaser output for the Scoop publisher. The generated manifest should land
