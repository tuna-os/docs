Thanks for wanting to help! Tavern is a GTK 4 / Libadwaita Homebrew client written in Python with Blueprint UI definitions.

## Dev setup

Install build dependencies (Homebrew on Linux or macOS):

```bash
brew install gtk4 libadwaita meson ninja pygobject3 gettext desktop-file-utils blueprint-compiler
```

Build, install to `~/.local`, and launch:

```bash
./run.sh                  # normal run
TAVERN_LOG=debug ./run.sh # with verbose logging
```

For a sandboxed Flatpak build (requires [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just)):

```bash
just dev                  # build + install + run as Flatpak
```

## Tests

Use the system Python with its PyGObject bindings. A separate Python install
such as `actions/setup-python` cannot use the distribution's `python3-gi`.
On Ubuntu, install the same dependencies as CI:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-gi python3-gi-cairo python3-pip \
  gir1.2-gtk-4.0 gir1.2-adw-1 gir1.2-gdkpixbuf-2.0 \
  libglib2.0-dev-bin libxml2-utils blueprint-compiler xvfb dbus-x11
/usr/bin/python3 -m pip install --break-system-packages pytest pytest-benchmark
```

Build the UI resource at the exact path that `tests/conftest.py` loads:

```bash
mkdir -p build-ui .flatpak-build/files/share/tavern
blueprint-compiler batch-compile build-ui src src/*.blp
cp src/style.css build-ui/
glib-compile-resources \
  --target=.flatpak-build/files/share/tavern/tavern.gresource \
  --sourcedir=build-ui --sourcedir=src src/tavern.gresource.xml

xvfb-run -a dbus-run-session -- /usr/bin/python3 -m pytest tests/ -m "not slow"
/usr/bin/python3 -m pytest tools/tests/
```

Use a file path in place of `tests/` to run one file. Add `--benchmark-enable`
to run benchmarks. The benchmark plugin is required even when benchmarks are off.
GTK needs a display and session bus; the fixtures alone do not provide these.
The host job may skip tests that need `Adw.Spinner` (libadwaita 1.6 or later).
Both the host and GNOME 50 Flatpak test jobs must pass before merge.
Use `just dev` for the separate Flatpak development path.

## Working on the UI

Blueprint files (`.blp`) compile to `.ui` XML at build time via `blueprint-compiler`. Always rebuild after editing a `.blp`:

```bash
./run.sh                  # re-runs blueprint-compiler
```

When adding a new page, keep Blueprint, Python, window wiring, gresource registration, and meson sources in sync — the repo layout in [README.md](https://github.com/tuna-os/Tavern/blob/main/README.md) and `src/` shows where each piece lands.

### Localization

Wrap every user-visible Blueprint value in `_()`, for example
`label: _("Install");`, and add new Blueprint/Python sources to
`po/POTFILES.in`. Python UI strings should use `gettext.gettext` (`_`) or
`ngettext` for plurals. Before opening a PR, run:

```bash
python3 tools/check-translations.py
meson setup build
meson compile -C build tavern-pot
```

Add a locale code to `po/LINGUAS` only when its `.po` catalog is ready to
ship. Translation-only PRs are welcome and do not require changes to Python.

## Pull requests

- Keep PRs focused — one change, one PR.
- Include a screenshot or short clip for any user-visible UI change.
- Run the test commands above before you open a PR.
- Reference the issue you're closing (`Closes #123`).

## Code style

- Match the surrounding style — Tavern is a small codebase, consistency matters more than any specific rule.
- Logging is off by default. New code should use `_log = get_logger('module_name')` from `logging_util`, not bare `print`.
- Backend I/O goes on a thread and reports back via `GLib.idle_add` — don't block the UI thread.
