Tavern keeps metadata and media below the platform cache directory (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/tavern` on Linux). The directory has a schema marker and is cleared automatically when the cache schema changes.

- Catalogs are refreshed after 12 hours, curation after 6 hours, and tap metadata after 24 hours.
- Stale catalog data remains usable while Tavern refreshes it or the machine is offline.
- JSON writes are atomic. Corrupt JSON is removed instead of being mistaken for an empty catalog.
- Reads update access time, and the 256 MiB quota evicts least-recently-used files first.
- Paths are resolved and checked before reads, writes, eviction, or clearing, so cache operations cannot escape Tavern's directory.

Preferences shows the current cache size and offers **Clear Cache**. Clearing affects downloaded metadata and images only; it never uninstalls packages or removes Homebrew state.
